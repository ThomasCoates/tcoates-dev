# tcoates-dev

This is the repo for my personal portfolio site: [tcoates.dev](https://tcoates.dev).  
It’s built with React and serves as a place to share my projects, skills, and experience.  

## Tech
- React  
- JavaScript/TypeScript  
- HTML & CSS  

## Notes
I’ll be updating the site over time as I add new projects, refine the design, and possibly include a personal blog.
